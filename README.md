##  Aim:
To use and implement C++ classes and objects.

## Software used:
Visual studio code.

## Theory
## Classes
Classes are the building blocks of object-oriented programming (OOP). A class is essentially a blueprint for creating objects. It encapsulates data and functions that operate on the data into a single unit.


## Objects
An object is an instance of a class. When you define a class, you create a blueprint for objects. Once the class is defined, you can create objects that follow the structure and behavior defined by the class.


## Algorithms
## Defining class and objects
1)Start  

2)Class Definition:  
3)Define a class named student with the following public data members:  

4)string name: To store the student's name.  
5)int age: To store the student's age.  
6)string branch: To store the student's branch of study.  
7)float result: To store the student's result.  
8)int year: To store the student's current academic year.  
9)int prn: To store the student's PRN (Personal Registration Number).  


Main Function:
1)Declare two objects s1 and s2 of the class student.  
2)Input and Output for First Student (s1):  
3)Assign the following values to the object s1:  

name = "Soham"  
age = 19  
branch = "ENTC"  
prn = 065  
result = 7.8  
year = 2 

4)Display the values stored in s1:   
5)Print the name, age, branch, prn, result, and year.    
6)Input and Output for Second Student (s2):    
7)Assign the following values to the object s2:   

name = "Hussain"  
age = 19  
branch = "ENTC"  
prn = 060  
result = 8.83  
year = 2   


8)Display the values stored in s2:    
9)Print the name, age, branch, prn, result, and year.    
10)End.    

## Defining Method in class  
Start

Class Definition:

Define a class named student.
Inside the class, define a public method named myMethod():
This method outputs the message: "I am studying in 2nd year.".
Main Function:

Declare an object s1 of the class student.

## Method Invocation:

Call the myMethod() function using the object s1.
Output:

The program prints the message "I am studying in 2nd year.".
End
